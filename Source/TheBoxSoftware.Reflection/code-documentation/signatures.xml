        <para>
        Class that represents the simplist single element when a type is involved in
        a signiture. Where for example a type can be represented simply as a base type
        a class, or a valuetype, the ElementTypeSignitureToken will contain the relevant
        details about it and provide a mechanism for resolving the type.
        </para>
        <para>
        Where a type is described by more than a single element; that element will have
        its superflous detail described in the <see cref="TypeSignatureToken"/> class.

      <para>
      An ElementTypeSignitureToken details the element of a Type signiture. These
      elements are defined in section 23.1.16 in ECMA 335. Where a type can contain
      multiple ElementTypeSignitureTokens each building up to reveal more information
      about the type. This class will only ever provide a single item of detail.

        <para>
        Represents an element of a signiture that can be used to resolve back to a type,
        however the type it resolves back to can be one of many things; see ECMA 335
        23.2.12.
        </para>
        <para>
        A type can be represented by one or more tokens, hence this token derives from
        <see cref="SignatureTokenContainer"/>. However it will always have an <see cref="ElementTypeSignatureToken"/>
        which should allow any resolving to be perfomed more easily.
