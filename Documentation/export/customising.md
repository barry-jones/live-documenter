# Customising the output

All of the LDEC files shipped with the Live Documenter can be customised simply by unzipping the contents of the LDEC file to a directory and modifying the CSS. When zipped up again and placed in the ApplicationData folder these will be available in the export dialogue.

More complication customisation of the output will require a broader knowledge of the file and it's contents which can be found [here](../live-documenter-export-configuration).
