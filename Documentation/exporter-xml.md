# Exporter XML

This a basic processor, the one out of the box simply outputs the basic XML that the Live Documenter uses as an intermediate rich XML document for later processing to other formats.

Specifying extra information in an XML LDEC file such as an XSLT will not do anything. The processor does not perform any extra transform processing steps. If you want to convert from our base XML format to another, then the [web exporter](exporter-web) is what you will need.

This exporter is provided to enable you to quickly see an entire XML output for a project for developing your own custom LDEC files, or for processing a standardised output in other applications.ÃŸ
