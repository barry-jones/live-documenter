# Web Exporter

The web exporter is an internal processor for converting files from one source to another using the specified LDEC XSLT file. Web is a bit of a misnomer as the processor does not really care what you convert the originating XML to.

This processor then is the most flexible, it can be used to convert to file formats such as static HTM files, dynamic PHP, .NET or even Markdown. Conceviably you could also generate XSL:FO files for later processing in to PDF files.
